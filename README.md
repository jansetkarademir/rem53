# rem53 - NFC Business Card


### Description
In this project, we will record our contact details through Bluetooth LE using the nRF Connect mobile application and keep these records permanently in Thingy:53â€™s Non-Volatile Storage (NVS). We will be saving these records as NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format), which then will be readable with an NFC reader.
